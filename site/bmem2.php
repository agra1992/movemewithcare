<span class="bheading1">8. Network Fee</span><br />
<br>

We are considered to be a referral service or also for the connection between You and the Customer. Linear pricing is applied to all Labor only providers (Loading/Unloading, Packing, unpacking). It is free to join but all network members will accept linear pricing to avoid any price war between members servicing the network. All 1 men, 2 men, 3 men, 4 men or 5 men job will charge the customer the same amount of money for the first three hours of work, including travel time. Basically, all network members will be compensated the same for the first three hours and any additional hours afterwards will be charged the same to the customer to avoid any discrepancy on the hourly rates. All customers who require a service provider (labor only) from the network will be charged a flat fee. This flat fee represents a portion of what you would normally charge the customer outside the network. So the linear pricing concept is that all network members providing labor services for 1 men at 170 dollars ( for the first three hours), 2 men will receive a total of 260 dollars ( for the first three hours), for 3 men a total of 310 dollars( for the first three hours) and 4 men 375 dollars( for the first three hours) and finally 5 men, if you do offer that option will receive 520 dollars for the first three hours, including your travel time. Any additional hours after the 3 hours will be for 1 men is 55 dollars per hour, 2 men is 80 dollars per hour, for 3 men is 90 dollars per hour, 4 men is 105 dollars per hour and 5 men 120 dollars per hour. These additional charges are linear and should be charge equally among all network providers. All should have same pricing structure.<br /><br>

You agree that Our Fee is not an additional amount to be charged or collected in addition to the total amount that you usually charge outside the network.<br /><br>

<span class="bheading1">9. Payment for Services</span><br />
<br>

You acknowledge and agree that payment for the Services will be made at the day of the move and should be collected then. You can also communicate with your customer and agree on a method of payment, which should be under your discretion. Once a job is posted by the customer, an email is sent to all network members in the area of where the customer lives. Once the email sent to the network members to log into Your account, you should be quick enough to do so and accept the job. It is a first come first serve policy.<br /><br>

<span class="bheading1">10. Your Obligation to Us</span><br />
<br>

By accepting the job, you are responsible to perform the job to the best of your abilities, with professionalism and dedication to your customer. You represent the network for that specific job and also your reputation among the accredited organization across America.
