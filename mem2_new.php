                  <h5>
                    We are considered to be a referral service or also for the connection between You and the Customer. Linear pricing is applied to all Labor only providers (Loading/Unloading, Packing, unpacking). It is free to join but all network members will accept linear pricing to avoid any price war between members servicing the network. All 1 men, 2 men, 3 men, 4 men or 5 men job will charge the customer the same amount of money for the first three hours of work, including travel time. Basically, all network members will be compensated the same for the first three hours and any additional hours afterwards will be charged the same to the customer to avoid any discrepancy on the hourly rates. All customers who require a service provider (labor only) from the network will be charged a flat fee. This flat fee represents a portion of what you would normally charge the customer outside the network. So the linear pricing concept is that all network members providing labor services for 1 men at 170 dollars ( for the first three hours), 2 men will receive a total of 260 dollars ( for the first three hours), for 3 men a total of 310 dollars( for the first three hours) and 4 men 375 dollars( for the first three hours) and finally 5 men, if you do offer that option will receive 520 dollars for the first three hours, including your travel time. Any additional hours after the 3 hours will be for 1 men is 55 dollars per hour, 2 men is 80 dollars per hour, for 3 men is 90 dollars per hour, 4 men is 105 dollars per hour and 5 men 120 dollars per hour. These additional charges are linear and should be charge equally among all network providers. All should have same pricing structure.

                  <h2><strong>Arbitration</strong></h2>
                  <h5>
                    Except as set forth later in this Section, any dispute, legal controversy, legal action or legal claim arising out of or relating to Our network or this Agreement shall be settled by mandatory, binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) the accredited organization in which the network member is affiliated with, or with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The arbitrator shall be selected by the joint agreement of the parties, but if they do not so agree, the selection shall be made by AAA pursuant to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. The findings of the arbitrator may not change the express terms of this Agreement and shall be consistent with the arbitrator's understanding of the findings a court of proper jurisdiction would make in applying the applicable law to the facts underlying the dispute. This provision for arbitration shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding with no right to appeal. The arbitrator shall at no time award injunctive relief. The arbitrator shall at no time award relief in excess of that provided for in the Agreement and furthermore, in any event, an arbitration award shall not include an award of punitive damages and the parties hereby waive the right to recover punitive damages. Each party shall pay its own expenses of arbitration and the expense of the arbitrator shall be shared equally. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or action or controversy of any other party. The arbitration shall be conducted in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction thereof. The laws of the State of Maryland shall exclusively apply in any arbitration. Should either party file any action contrary to this provision, the other party may recover reasonable attorney fees and reasonable costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You expressly consent that this arbitration clause shall not apply in any manner to Our rights to seek to obtain damages for, or an injunction relating to, fraud committed against Our network or the infringement against Our intellectual property.
